# The library relies on the creation of one object per each chemical specie.
# These objects store the specific parameters of the chemical specie they represent, e.g. radi, pKa, charge, etc. 
# This library provides tools that use these objects to set-up molecular dynamics simulations using Espresso. 

# Let us ilustrate this concept with the example of a peptide. A peptide is a macromolecule which is composed by several aminoacids which, in turn, have several chemical groups.
# In the same way, in this library a peptide object contains several aminoacid objects. In turn, each aminoacid object contains bead objects, whose number depends on the desired model. 

# Practically, to create a peptide object one only needs to provide the aminoacid sequence to the library
# The prefered format is a single string using the one-letter aminoacid code of the peptide. The amino and carboxyl ends are denoted as 'c' and 'n' respectively and must be provided in lower case.

# The library includes a sequence parser that reads the input sequence and automatically transforms it to the one-letter nomenclature. As a result, examples 1-3 yield to the creation of the same protein object.

# By default, the library assumes that the peptide is modelled as a linear chain with one bead per aminoacid.
# However, the user can also choose to model the peptide as a chain with side chains, i.e. with two beads per aminoacid.

#  Values for the phosphorilated aminoacids J U and Z are always taken from Ref. 5

# The pKa-values not specified by the user are assumed to be equal to those provided in Ref. 1 (Hass et al.).

# Once the user creates the peptide object with the desired properties, the library contains several useful modules that help the user to set-up a constant pH simulation of such peptide with Espresso 
# For instance, let us consider the case that you want to simulate two peptide chains of sequence "cGHACCFVn" using the two bead model and the default pKa-values.
